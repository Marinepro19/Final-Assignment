John Lemon's Haunted Jaunt


Sebastian Obregon - me

The modifications I have done to the game are adding a timer to the game that causes you to get caught if it finishes. - Changes made by creating the timer script and text object
I also have added a speed boost to John if you press and hold shift. - Changes made in the PlayerMovement.cs script
